The AOS (Animate On Scroll) library offers a variety of built-in animations. Here's a list of AOS animations you can use by simply setting the data-aos attribute:

Fading animations:
fade
fade-up
fade-down
fade-left
fade-right
fade-up-right
fade-up-left
fade-down-right
fade-down-left
Flipping animations:
flip-up
flip-down
flip-left
flip-right
Sliding animations:
slide-up
slide-down
slide-left
slide-right
Zooming animations:
zoom-in
zoom-in-up
zoom-in-down
zoom-in-left
zoom-in-right
zoom-out
zoom-out-up
zoom-out-down
zoom-out-left
zoom-out-right

You can apply any of these animations by setting the data-aos attribute on an element. For instance:
<div data-aos="zoom-in-left">
  This content will zoom in from the left when it comes into view!
</div>

To tweak the animation's behavior, you can use additional data-aos-* attributes:
Duration: data-aos-duration="1000" (time in milliseconds)
Easing: data-aos-easing="ease-in-out"
Delay: data-aos-delay="300" (time in milliseconds)
Offset: data-aos-offset="50" (in pixels, dictates at which point the animation triggers)

Example:
<div data-aos="slide-up" data-aos-duration="1500" data-aos-delay="200">
  This content will slide up over 1.5 seconds, with a delay of 200ms!
</div>

To see all available animations and their visual demonstrations, you can refer to the AOS library's official demo page or documentation.

ANCHOR PLACEMENT:
Anchor placement is one of the key concepts that allows you to fine-tune when AOS animations are triggered during scrolling. The idea is based on a combination of two settings: data-aos-anchor-placement and data-aos-offset.


Anchor Element:
By default, the element that you want to animate is the "anchor". This means the animation trigger depends on when this element enters or exits the viewport.
Optionally, you can specify a different element as the anchor using data-aos-anchor. This allows another element's position to determine when the animation is triggered.
Anchor Placement:

This setting determines which part of the anchor element (either the element itself or another element specified using data-aos-anchor) should be used in conjunction with the offset to trigger the animation.
It's defined as a combination of two values: one for the anchor element and one for the viewport. They can be top, center, or bottom.
The format is anchor-viewport.
Examples:

top-bottom: This is the default. It means the animation will be triggered when the top of the anchor element reaches the bottom of the viewport.
center-center: The animation will be triggered when the center of the anchor element is at the center of the viewport.
bottom-top: The animation will be triggered when the bottom of the anchor element reaches the top of the viewport.
... and so on for other combinations.

Offset:
This setting, defined by data-aos-offset, allows you to adjust the trigger point by a specified number of pixels.
It can be positive (pushing the trigger point further down) or negative (pulling the trigger point up).
By default, the offset is 120 pixels.
For a practical example, let's consider the following:

<div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="center-center" data-aos-offset="50">
  This content will fade up when its center is 50 pixels above the center of the viewport.
</div>
In this case, when the center of the <div> is 50 pixels above the center of the viewport, the fade-up animation will be triggered.


SETTINGS FOR ENTIRE PAGE: 
<script>
    AOS.init({
        offset: 40,    // offset (in px) from the original trigger point
        delay: 1,       // values from 0 to 3000, with step 50ms
        duration: 800,  // values from 0 to 3000, with step 50ms
        easing: 'ease', // default easing for AOS animations
        once: false,    // whether animation should happen only once
    });
